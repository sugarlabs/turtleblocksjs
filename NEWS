TODO:

  * Use graphical error messages
  * Make expand an array, one element for each arg or slot
  * User-defined block types (trivial with factory)
  * Three-arg arg blocks (trivial with factory)
  * Artwork beautification?
  * Try to detect difference between unknown flow and arg blocks

    - two args: artwork for the button; action name to take
  * What palette/block features from the Python version do we need to port?

FEATURE IDEAS:

  * Arrays

KNOWN BUGS:
  * Find a scalable approach to drawing on the canvas
  * Not all blocks highlight when using step-by-step mode
