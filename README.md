TurtleBlocks JS
===============
<img src='https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/blob/master/activity/logo.png' />

Turtle Blocks Javascript is an activity with a
Logo-inspired graphical "turtle" that draws colorful art based on
snap-together visual programming elements. Its "low floor" provides an
easy entry point for beginners. It also has "high ceiling"
programming, graphics, mathematics, and Computer Science features
which will challenge the more adventurous student.

> Note: Turtle Blocks JS closely parallels the Python version of Turtle
> Blocks, the version included in the Sugar distribution. Sugar users
> probably want to use Turtle Blocks rather than Turtle Blocks JS.

Using Turtle Art JS
------------------- 

Turtle Blocks JS (Javascript) is designed to run in a browser. Most of
the development has been done in Chrome, but it should also work in
Firefox, Opera, and Safari. You can run it directly from index.html,
from a [server maintained by Sugar Labs](http://turtle.sugarlabs.org),
from the [github
repo](http://rawgit.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/index.html),
or by setting up a [local
server](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/blob/master/server.md).

Sugar users can run Turtle Blocks JS as an app embedded in the Browse
activity (See [Turtle Blocks
Embedded](https://github.com/sugarlabs/turtle-blocks-embedded-activity))
or simply open Turtle Blocks JS in Browse.

Once you've launched it in your browser, start by clicking on (or
dragging) blocks from the Turtle palette. Use multiple blocks to
create drawings; as the turtle moves under your control, colorful
lines are drawn.

You add blocks to your program by clicking on or dragging them from
the palette to the main area. You can delete a block by dragging it
back onto the palette. Click anywhere on a “stack” of blocks to start
executing that stack or by clicking in the Big Play Button 
(fast running) or press it for a long while for the Turtle
to run (slowly) on the Main Toolbar.

Getting Started Documentation
-----------------------------

The basic buttons and basic blocks are explained in detail in [Documentation](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/blob/master/documentation/README.md).

A guide to programming with Turtle Blocks is available in [Turtle Blocks Guide](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/blob/master/guide/README.md).

Advanced Features
-----------------

Turtle Blocks has a plugin mechanism that is used to add new
blocks. You can learn more about how to use plugins (and how to write
them) from the [Plugins
Guide](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/blob/master/plugins/README.md).
