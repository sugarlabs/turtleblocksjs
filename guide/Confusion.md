Turtle Confusion presents 40 shape challenges to the learner that must
be completed using basic Logo-blocks. The challenges are based on
Barry Newell’s 1988 book, *Turtle Confusion: Logo Puzzles and
Riddles*. Gary Stager has posted a [scan of Newell’s
book](http://constructingmodernknowledge.com/tcbook.pdf) (with
permission of the author) ([en
español](http://github.com/downloads/humitos/turtle-confusion-es/la-confusion-de-la-tortuga.pdf)).

Below is a collections of Turtle Blocks projects stored on
the Planet that presents 40 shape challenges to be programmed by
moving the Logo turtle.

----

1. Click on a challenge from the images below (or by searching for
'Challenge' on the Planet).

2. Use blocks from the various Turtle Block palettes to instruct the
Logo turtle to replicate the pattern.

Most of the challenges are problems of symmetry and geometry which
typically can be solved by using a combination of rotations and repeat
blocks. You may have to use the *Pen Up* and *Pen Down* blocks on
occasion.
